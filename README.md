## How to Run

### Initialization

- **Environment Requirements**: Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed.
- **Download the Project**: Use the following command to clone the repository.
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shword07117/AIPsychoBench
    cd AIPsychoBench
```
- **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary libraries.
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure API Keys

- Open the `config.yaml` file.
- Add your API keys for services such as Azure Translation API, OpenAI, or other required APIs.
- Example configuration for OpenAI API keys:
```yaml
  api:
    Openai:
      base_url: THE_LLM_SERVER_URL
      api_key:
        gpt-3.5-turbo: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

### Set Running Parameters


Edit the `config.yaml` file to configure the system:

```yaml
# Questionnaire Generation Configuration
questionnaire_generation:
  base:
    enabled: true
    all: false 
    questionnaires:
      BFI: true      # Enable BFI questionnaire
    inner_setting_type: "LRP"  # Set role type
    output_dir: "generated_questionnaires/"
  
  translation:
    enabled: true
    target_languages: 
      de: true
      
# Questionnaire Testing Configuration
questionnaire_testing:
  base:
    enabled: true
    models:
      - "gpt-4o"
    languages:
      de: true
    inner_setting_types: 
      LRP: true
```

### Run the Code

```bash
  python main.py
```

- The system will automatically generate questionnaires in the specified languages based on the configuration.
- Generated questionnaires are saved in the `generated_questionnaires/` directory.
